Information about development characteristiks of the project:

Work on the game project Nonogram started 2 weeks ago. Most of the time I spent during development was on the logistics and planning ahead. For more than I week I planned the project's most important functions,
how to implement most of the games' prominent feathures and how to combine them all in one project. It took me 6 or 5 days of programing and writing the code.

The project is separated in two header files and one cpp. I used two or three libraries, one of which reads my game files. I used the most of my availiable resources and a lot of functions and comands from the libraries.
There are also 15 different files with game levels and information about them. There also is a file which keeps the names of the old users of the game.

The game starts with asking you for your username and in case you've played before it asks if you want to continue your last game. Then if you are new or you chose to play new level, the game asks you what difficulty do you prefer.
After that it generates one of the levels. The game prints also information about the rows and columns which are read from top to bottom for the rows and left to right for the columns.
The way that the player chooses a cell is by writing the coordinates of the cell which start with x=1 and y=1 for the cell on the bottom left corner. The player choose and action, one of which is for quiting
which will save all of the current info and end the game. The game ends when either the player finds all the squares and wins or loses all of his lives and loose.
